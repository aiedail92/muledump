## Synopsis

This tool allows you to list contents of all your accounts in a single page (characters, their stats and items, items in vaults). Also it generates a summary of all the items - you probably saw screenshots of these in trading forum ([example](http://i755.photobucket.com/albums/xx195/Ind3sisiv3/Ilovemuledump.png)).

The point of playing the game is to have fun. Muling is not fun. I am trying to increase overall fun ratio by decreasing amount of time spent fussing with mules and storagekeeping.

## Download

All released versions are [here](https://github.com/atomizer/muledump/tags).

## Howto

- unpack
- edit **`accounts_sample.js`**
- rename it to **`accounts.js`**
- open **`muledump.html`**

## Troubleshooting & Frequently Asked Questions

### It redirected me to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ-wO7SMtOg)! What did I do wrong?

There are four common pitfalls:
- you didnt edit your `accounts.js` file. I mean, come on.
- you didnt delete/replace both example accounts from said file.
- you broke syntax when you were editing your `accounts.js`. Use an editor with syntax hilighting and common sense.
- you failed to rename it properly because of your file manager. In Windows, try to [enable file name extensions](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-or-hide-file-name-extensions).

### It doesnt work in my Internet Explorer!

A modern browser is required for muledump to work. Use latest [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/).

### Q: How do I use it with a Kongregate account?

- follow [this](http://forums.wildshadow.com/node/27826) to **step 8**
- from step 8, take **`user_id`** and **`game_auth_token`** values
- go [here](http://realmofthemadgod.appspot.com/kongregate/getcredentials?userId=YOUR_USER_ID&gameAuthToken=YOUR_GAT)
- in address bar, replace fields written in CAPS with your user id and auth token
- take `GUID` and `Secret` from result - use them as email and password

### Q: How do I use it with a Steam account?

### I want to say something! And there is no thread! Wat do?

Feel free to send me a [private message](https://forums.wildshadow.com/messages/new/4041) on the forums. Maybe later there will be more options.

### I want to contribute!

Great! Fork the repo, make your changes, send pull request. Alternatively, you can just send me a diff or something.

## Skins

There are BMJ's [skins](http://forums.wildshadow.com/node/63758) for those who dont like the default look.

## Optional feature: one click login

**Windows only!** Apparently doesnt work on Chrome at the moment!

[FizzeBu](http://forums.wildshadow.com/user/24488) wrote a great AutoIt script, which allows this magic to be real.

**How to enable:**

* install [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/)
* change `mulelogin` in `accounts.js` to `1`
* run `lib/mulelogin.au3` once
* refresh, click arrows next to reload buttons
* never share your `muledump:` links!

**How to remove:**

If you are too sceptical/afraid to even try, just remove `mulelogin.au3`. No harm done.

If already installed:

* change `mulelogin` to `0`
* run `lib/mulelogin.au3`, select "uninstall".

## Optional feature: display prices from Kazansky's price guide

*Since there are no accurate price guides at the moment, this feature is pretty much useless.*

[aiedail92](https://github.com/aiedail92) implemented scraping of [Kaz's thread](https://forums.wildshadow.com/node/100708).

**How to enable:** change `prices` in `accounts.js` to `1`
